If there's one thing that I've always enjoyed about computers, it's putting stuff on the screen.

I started with Python, and soon afterwards began working in the world of web development.

The feeling seeing small CSS adjustments appear on a page, or some new text I’ve written getting painted to the screen - the feeling of creating something. That really means something to me.

But the overall domain of web development wasn't *really* what I wanted to work on full-time. I soon transitioned over into writing, something else that I enjoy. I do a lot of technical content writing, tutorials, blog posts, and more. And it's fun.

It’s funny how things happen in life. One of my favourite games when I was younger was Destiny. I ended up becoming a Sherpa, which for those unaware, is a kind of guide to help newer players learn raid mechanics and beat bosses.

Now here I am doing technical education, but instead of telling people how to slay Oryx, I’m telling them about how computers work.

I'll continue writing for the foreseeable future - but in programming, I’m becoming further and further removed from the creativity that originally inspired me to start coding.

Outside of this I've always been fascinated by video games. And on top of that, I've always had that itch to understand how complex systems work under the hood.

Putting these two together, I've found the areas I want to pursue: game development and graphics programming.

For a while now, I’ve been trying to find the area of computer programming that would "nerd snipe" me. And honestly, I think this is it.

The goal of this conquest? To be honest… I’d be lying if I said I knew.

For now my goal is to learn. Learn the math behind it, learn the frameworks, programming languages, and build projects that I feel are meaningful.

A lovely result from all of this would be full-time employment of some kind.

Here on my blog I’ll be documenting my learning journey, sharing notes, as well as “tutorials”, if I dare call them that - to help me solidify my learning (and hopefully help those who are only a couple of steps behind myself).

In the words of Professor Rowan: *"Your very own tale of grand adventure is about to unfold."*

I hope you enjoy taking this journey with me!
