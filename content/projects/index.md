# Personal projects

These are just some side projects I've created for fun, or to help me learn certain topics.

### [ani.town](https://ani.town)

A social website for querying anime data. Bad idea, but learnt a lot.

Tools used: SvelteKit, Supabase, GraphQL

Key learnings: JWT Authentication, setting up/modelling PostgreSQL databases

# Professional projects

My professional software development experience includes building web applications, creating data scraping/cleaning scripts, and working with GraphQL.

I am proficient with Python, JS/TS, and most of the frontend web stack.

Most of my professional code is proprietary and/or archived.
