# Under Construction ðŸš§

# Personal projects

These are just some side projects I've created for fun, or to help me learn certain topics.

### [ani.town](https://ani.town)

A social website for querying anime data. Bad idea, but learnt a lot.

Tools used: SvelteKit, Supabase, GraphQL

Key learnings: JWT Authentication, setting up/modelling PostgreSQL databases

# Professional projects

I have done a reasonable amount of software development professionally, including building web applications, and setting up data scraping and cleaning scripts for GraphQL data.

Python is the language I'm most proficient with, followed by most of the frontend web stack. I'm also learning C.
