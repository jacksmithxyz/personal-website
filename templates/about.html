<h1>about me</h1>
<p>
    Hi Iâ€™m Jack, a freelance technical content writer from the UK, (mostly)
    focused on emerging technology. My previous/current clients include
    hyper-growth startups like
    <a href="https://layer3.xyz">layer3</a> and
    <a href="https://turnkey.com">turnkey</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I like programming for fun, mainly focused on automation or solving problems
    with CLI/TUI applications. I also tend to get nerd-sniped by esoteric and
    nascent languages and tools.
