        Hi I’m Jack 👋 welcome to my personal website. I’ve spent the last few
        years working at crypto startups doing web development and other things. I'm currently focused
        on backend development and learning Rust.

        This blog is where I share my journey and learnings, as well as any of my creative endeavours.
        Grab a cup of tea and get cozy, I hope you enjoy your stay. 🍵
