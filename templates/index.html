    <p>Hey there, I’m Jack. Welcome to my little corner of the web. 🍵</p>
    <p>
        I'm a software developer and content writer exploring game development
        and graphics programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy writing, and here you'll find blog posts on my own learning
        journey as well as anything else I find interesting. My guiding
        principle is
        <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a> 改善.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I’m building a future together with my beautiful
        fiancée. I hope you enjoy your stay!
    </p>
