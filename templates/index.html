    <p>
        Hi I'm Jack, a freelance software developer and technical writer from
        the UK. I’ve spent the last few years working with startups creating
        developer-focused and technical content. My guiding principle is
        <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a> 改善.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a curious person who enjoys learning. I like to explore different
        areas of computers that interest me for enjoyment and to help improve at
        my craft. Outside of work, I’m building a future together with my
        beautiful fiancée.
    </p>
